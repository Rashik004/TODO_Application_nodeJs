# NodeJs Todo App

This app was developed as a part of learning nodejs via the youtube channel **The Net Ninja** with there playlist [**Node JS Tutorial for Beginners**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU). This app demonstrates a basic Todo app with the capability of:

  - Adding a to-do item
  - Deleting a to-do item
  - Saving the todo items in a mongodb server

**Thans to the _The Net Ninja_ Team for their awesome tutorial!!**
